> Introductory book to the Physics of radiation, with emphasis on atmospheric related applications. The book contains a good selection of exercises and it was written with a easy to read style

The book of G.W. Petty about Atmospheric Radiation (see here) , while it is an introductory book contains almost every topic that a university student or young researcher may need. Just I missed a more detailed further reading section to guide the reader a little bit more to the field.

The previous knowledge needed to follow the book is just the logical mathematical skills and a capacity to follow the physics reasoning of the author. But the book doesn't rely too much on Electromagnetic or Optics physics with is only used at the beginning of the book to explain the nature of the light. The book, as usual in this field cover the phenomena of absorption, emission and scattering of light which always are described focused on atmospheric radiation applications. Equations for multiple scattering radiation transfer theory are included together with the typical Legendre Polynomial based expansion of the Phase Function, but probably additional information would needed for those reader most interested on the mathematical side of radiative transfer theory. The practical problem of line by line calculation and the k-correlation approach to solve (partially) this problem is successfully and very intuitively explained. In general the goal of the author of explain to the reader the way of reasoning on atmospheric radiation is nicely achieved.

The readers interested on remote sensing by satellite in subjects like atmospheric chemistry or cloud physics without a previous background on this applications will find quite useful have this book close in the working desk.
