> Review of the introductory book to Atmospheric Physics written by David G. Andrews. Concise and useful, it ia a well presented introduction to atmospheric physics covering key aspects and given additional references for those readers who might need additional insights on specific topics. It has well selected problems to be resolved by the reader. Recommented.

After a first overview, my intial conclusion is that it is more useful as a initiation book than the broadly known book "Atmospheric Science (an introductory survey)" of J.M.Wallace, which probably gives too many details to the reader instead of only focus on the relevant physical meaning. Probably this last book is more useful like a general reference.

The author presents an concise introduction to several topics on Atmospheric Physics. No previous knowledge is supposed and the different subjects are explained on a consistent exposition mainly self-contained. However a good basis of calculus is needed, particularly in the chapters describing fluid dynamics, and partially on the radiative theory when the radiometric amounts are defined. 

For a undergraduate students of any scientific discipline it is a interesting introduction book. Note that there are four main chapters followed by 5 chapters of different topics but yet written for readers with no previous background on meteorology or atmospheric sciences. Probably, the chapters describing the common approximations to the dynamical equations, together with the parts related with remote sensing and climate modelling should be also part of a minimum approach to atmospheric physics. Particularly, I found very well exposed the topics of atmospheric thermodynamics, basic fluid dynamics or radiative transfer theory and yet with a minimum previous knowledge on physics and mathematics. However if the reader is looking for other topics like conceptual models on meteorology, cloud physics or data-assimilation applied to atmospheric physics other references are needed.

The problems contained on each chapter provide a necessary complement to understand correctly the topics described. Meanwhile, the set of references provided is enough, probably a student with interest on an specific subject will need more sources of information for the bibliography.

In my opinion, a good book that I recommend for introductory courses on sciences under-graduate programs.
