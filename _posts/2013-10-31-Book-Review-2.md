> Concise Review of the introductory book to Atmospheric Physics written by David G. Andrews. Personally I founded it more useful on several aspects than the broadly known book "Atmospheric Science (an introductory survey)" of J.M.Wallace, which probably gives too many details to the reader instead of focus on the relevant physical meaning. Probably this last book is more useful like a general reference.

The author presents an concise introduction to several topics on Atmospheric Physics. No previous knowledge is supposed and the different subjects are explained on a consistent exposition mainly self-contained.

For a undergraduate students of any scientific discipline it is a interesting introduction book. In my personal opinion I have found his concise approach more useful than other more encyclopedic books like Atmospheric Science of John M. Wallace and Peter V. Hobbs, at least for a beginner. The topics of atmospheric thermodynamics, basic fluid dynamics or radiative transfer theory are well exposed with a minimum previous knowledge on physics and mathematics. However if the reader is looking for other topics like conceptual models on meteorology, cloud physics or data-assimilation applied to atmospheric physics other references are needed.

The problems contained on each chapter provide a necessary complement to understand correctly the topics described. And finally the set of references is enough, but probably a student with interest on an specific subject may need more sources of information for the bibliography.

In my opinion, a good book that I recommend for introductory courses on sciences under-graduate programs.
