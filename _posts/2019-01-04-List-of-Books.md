List of Books
---------------------------

Number of [+] indicate the difficulty on a scale of 1-5.

### Maths and Statistics

- [++++] **A user's guide to measure theoretic probability** (*David Pollard*): This book has more text than usual in probability related books, but still is a quite serious book. It covers many aspects like fourier transforms, brownian motion or hilbert spaces from the point of view of measure theory. *Mostly self-contained*.
- [++++] **Probability, an introduction** (*G. Grimmett and D. Welsh*)

### Atmospheric Physics-Chemistry

- [+++] **Modeling of Atmospheric Chemistry** (*Brasseur and Jacob*): Not yet a classical book on the field but close to be. It covers almost all the topics related with modeling chemistry in the atmosphere. Althoghh some topics are note treated deeply, the books has a very good balance between rigurosity, readability and details. It is avery good book to introduce (and more than introduce) the reader on this research field. *Self-contained*.
- [+++] **Parameterization Schemes** (*David J. Stensrud*): Introduces the main parameterizations of numerical weather prediction models (also shared with climate models): it includes land surface modelling, cloud physics (convection and cloud microphysics), radiation scheme, soil-vegetation interactions, sea-atmosphere interactions, orography and turbulence. Therefore if covers the main classical parameterization schemes, and the reader will have a clear idea of how others might work: particle emission schemes are close related with sea-atmosphere and land-atmosphere interactions, the ideas of microphysics parameterizations could be extended to aerosols particle size distributios. *Mostly self-contained*.
- [+++] **An introduction to Atmospheric Physics** (*David G. Andrews*): *Mostly self-contained*.

### Atmospheric Radiation
- [+++] **A first course in Atmospheric Radiation** (*Grant W. Petty*): *Self-contained*.
