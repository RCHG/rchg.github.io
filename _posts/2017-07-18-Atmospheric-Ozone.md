### Theory of Chapman

It is one of the first, but still useful, theories developed with the objective of explain the production and removing of Ozone on the atmosphere. It proposes a set of chemical reations: 

- Photochemical formation

   $$ O_{3}+h\nu \longrightarrow O+O$$
   
   $$ O_{2}+O+M \longrightarrow  O_{3} + M$$
   
   Here M is a kind of mediator/catalitic of the chemical reaction, for example $$N_{2}$$. And the light involved belongs to the UV should have a wavelenght  $$ \lambda  \leq 242 nm $$ 
   
- Destruction

   $$ O_{3}+h\nu\longrightarrow  O_{2}+O, \qquad \text{with} \qquad \lambda  \leq 850 nm $$
   
   $$ O_{2}+h\nu \longrightarrow  O_{2}+O(D), \qquad \text{with} \qquad \lambda \leq 320 nm $$
   
- Producing Oxigen molecule O2

   $$ O_{3}+O \longrightarrow  2O_{2}$$ 
   
   $$ O+O+M   \longrightarrow  O_{2}+M$$ 
   
   Here M is also kind of mediator/catalitic of the chemical reaction, for example $$N_{2}$$.

The balance between all these equations gives us the estimation of the concentrations.

> According with this theory the formation on O3 is larger on those latitudes with higher incoming UV radiation from the sun, and also un the upper-half part of the atmosphere. However also daily and seasonal variations of incoming radiance will have a direct impact on the formation of Ozone.

### Ozone Depletion

The Theory of Chapman describes the production of Ozone on the stratosphere but it fails to full describe the ozone depletion that happened mainly during the 70's and 80's. Whence, the original proposal was complemented by chemical reactions involving the now commontly named: ozone depleting substances (ODS) in oposition to for example, ozone precursors. Two families of ODS are named chlorine and bromine compounds. In the case of the chlorine (for examples CFCs) it is possible to have now reactions like:

   $$ CFCl_{3}+h\nu \longrightarrow Cl +\, others$$

and

   $$ Cl+O_{3} \longrightarrow ClO +O_{2}, \qquad \text{with} \qquad \lambda  \leq 230 nm $$

And we can realize that the previous theory of Chapman is now incomplete. Also similar reactions involving Br, $$NO_{x}$$ or $$HO_{x}$$ compounds are possible. Obviusly the process is more complex, and for example Cl can react with $$CH_{4}$$. Finally note that these chain-reactions are conditioned by the atmospheric transport on the trosposphere and stratosphere, and also scavening processes on the troposphere.
