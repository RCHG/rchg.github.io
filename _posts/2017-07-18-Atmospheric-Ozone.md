### Theory of Chapman

It is one of the first, but still useful, theories developed with the objective of explain the production and removing of Ozone on the atmosphere. It proposes a set of chemical reations: 

1. Photochemical formation:
   $$ O_{3}+h\nu \longarrow O+O$$
   $$ O_{2}+O+M  \longarrow O_{3} + M$$
   Here M is a kind of mediator/catalitic of the chemical reaction, for example $$N_{2}$$. And the light involved belongs to the UV ($$\lambda<242nm$$)
   
2. Destruction
   $$ O_{3}+h\nu \longarrow O_{2}+O$$ (with $$\lambda<850nm$$)
   $$ O_{2}+h\nu \longarrow O_{2}+O(D)$$ (with $$\lambda<320nm$$)
   
3.
   $$ O_{3}+O \longarrow 2O_{2}$$ 
   $$ O+O+M \longarrow O_{2}+M$$ 
   Here M is also kind of mediator/catalitic of the chemical reaction, for example $$N_{2}$$.
