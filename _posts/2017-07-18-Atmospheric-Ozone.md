### Theory of Chapman

It is one of the first, but still useful, theories developed with the objective of explain the production and removing of Ozone on the atmosphere. It proposes a set of chemical reations: 

- Photochemical formation

   $$ O_{3}+h\nu \longrightarrow O+O$$
   
   $$ O_{2}+O+M \longrightarrow  O_{3} + M$$
   
   Here M is a kind of mediator/catalitic of the chemical reaction, for example $$N_{2}$$. And the light involved belongs to the UV should have a wavelenght $$ l \leq 242 $$ nm.
   
- Destruction

   $$ O_{3}+h\nu\longrightarrow  O_{2}+O $$, with  l<850 nm
   
   $$ O_{2}+h\nu \longrightarrow  O_{2}+O(D)$$,with  l<l<320 nm
   
- Producing Oxigen molecule O2

   $$ O_{3}+O \longrightarrow  2O_{2}$$ 
   
   $$ O+O+M   \longrightarrow  O_{2}+M$$ 
   
   Here M is also kind of mediator/catalitic of the chemical reaction, for example $$N_{2}$$.

The balance between all these equations gives us the estimation of the concentrations.

> According with this theory the formation on O3 is larger on those latitudes with higher incoming UV radiation from the sun, and also un the upper-half part of the atmosphere. However also daily and seasonal variations of incoming radiance will have a direct impact on the formation of Ozone.
