## Overview

This is not an exhaustive description of the codes that I have developed but those that currently I maintain more often. 

### Open Source Sites/Repositories

- [github](https:/github.com/RCHG/): This is currently my main repository for open source codes.
- [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/rchecagarcia/) I collaborate in two projects under github.
- [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/u/rchecagarcia/profile) I barely use now for my own projects but still it is there.

Note: I am evaluating gitlab for future projects. 

### Earth Sciences 

#### Short pieces of code (not well documented)

- [pyozone](https://github.com/RCHG/pyozone): It is a piece of code that allows some python calculations. More information is also avaiable at [zenodo-link](https://zenodo.org/record/1118950)
- [mie-scattering](https://rchg.github.io//science-blog/Mie-Scattering/) Part of this code has been refactored and integrated in FunFAN

### FunFAN

The main idea of [FunFAN](https://github.com/RCHG/FunFAN) project is to have a set of modules and functions used for aerosols studies that can be easely incorporated in different kind of projects. Several functions has been used in mineral dust aerosol studies.

[Documentation](https://funfan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) It is documented online in readthedocs.
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3672001) It is registered in Zenodo so you can cite it:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3672001.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3672001)


### pyIPSLtools

[pyIPSLtools] https://github.com/RCHG/pyIPSLtool is a python software to prepate specific climate diagnostics for IPSL model. It also perform additional opertations to test the CF-compilant of the diagnostics (netcdf files) and typical test to ascertain the main properties of the climate simulations. 

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/41347471) It is registered in Zenodo so you can cite it: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4134747.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4134747)




#### With Fortran

- [SOCRATES-RF](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~vr912734/SOCRATESRF/index.html): it is a software suite based on SOCRATES but designed to have a different user interface and focused on the estimation of radiative forcing by offline methodologies. Currently it is able to estimate the radiative forcing by fixed dynamical heating method by adjusting the temperatures on the stratosphere.
- MaxEnt: it is a code programmed to estimate a probability density function according to a set of constrains that the pdf should fulfill, typically in the form of pdf-moments.

#### Latex

- I have prepared several templates, that I will upload soon to github or bitbucket 

#### Other
