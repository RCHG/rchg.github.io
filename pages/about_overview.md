### General Overview

Currently, my main field of research is the climate response to several agents on the atmosphere, either greenhouse gases or aerosols. However, my academic career started with a B.A. in Spanish from the University of Granada, where I graduated on Physics with an specialization on Theoretical Physics. Awarded with a scholarship, I obtained a M.Sc. on Condensed Matter with an dissertation about Theory of Liquids (Statistical Physics of Fluids) at the University Autónoma of Madrid. Also I was assistant professor of Physics (Laboratory Experiments) two years. In the field of Atmospheric Sciences, I have a PhD on Remote Sensing and Micro-physics of Precipitation at Spain with an stage at NASA Goddard Space Center (sponsored by University of Maryland-Baltimore County). My experience as Postdoctoral research assistant includes the institutions: Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), where I worked on ESA-Sentinel-5 and G3E projects (remote sensing of greenhouse gases). The University of Reading, in collaboration with Keith Shine and M. Hegglin, where I studed the radiative forcing of several agents on the atmosphere, in particular Ozone. And the Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment (LSCE) were I work for the CNRS on a aerosol related research project. 


### Scientific Interests

My objectives are a better understanding of the climate response to greenhouse gases and aerosols, but also improve my knowledge of remote sensing applied on earth sciences. For the first area, I investigates the climate variability and radiative forcing estimations together with the role of the Ozone on the climate system (which is complemented by my interest on numerical models of atmospheric processes at several scales). My interest on remote sensing comprises develop simulations of the actual measurement conditions to assert the uncertainty and new applications of remote sensing, but also in-situ measurement to calibrate, test and validate satellite products and improve retrieval algorithms. I am interested on carbon cycle and water cycle application of remote sensing science.

Due to my professional trajectory my interest is also related with mathematical methods, in particular those related with statistics and statistical physics. Together with scientific computing.

## Computing

### Overview
---

My daily research job is done with computers that I use for data analysis of experimental data and for modelling or simulation of physical processes. Therefore an important part of my background rely on an area usually named: **scientific computing**. Traditionaly, for a Physicist, this implied to know how to program with Fortran but not much more (maybe a basic understanding of Linux/Unix). Nowdays, the situation is different and scientific computing means a long list of tools and skills that a researcher have to know, but even more between all the utilities or methodologies she/he has to be able to choose the best possible tool for an specific problem. As a consequence several academic programs include a kind of formation that has been named **software carpentry**.
