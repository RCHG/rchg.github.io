### Info

In general is not given a central role to the formation in didactic in the academic career. The most
common hypothesis is that those scientists with good research background are going to be excellent teachers. Probably it is true that those good scientists are potentially good teachers but it is necessary to work on it to use properly these potential skills. Here I am including some resources that I have found useful, please contact with me if you know about other insteresting links.

### Journals

The researcher read about the progress in her/his scientific topics of interest but what about educational
journals? There are several useful journals for Physics Eduaction. In Europe IOP editorial has two journals

- [Physics Education ( schools and colleges)](http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/)
- [European Journal of Physics (universities and other higher education institutes)](http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/)

To motivate the students it is a good idea to be informed, for instance,
- [Physics World](http://iopscience.iop.org/2058-7058/)

In USA there are also several interesting journals

- [American Journal of Physics](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp)
- [Physics Teacher](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/tpt)

A main problem is that all these journals are not open-source. So I recommend to check also arxiv,

- [Popular Physics](http://arxiv.org/list/physics.pop-ph/recent)
- [Physics and Society](http://arxiv.org/list/physics.soc-ph/recent)
- [Physics Education](http://arxiv.org/list/physics.ed-ph/recent)
- [History and Philosophy of Physics](http://arxiv.org/list/physics.hist-ph/recent)

### History and Didactic

This last link is interesting not only because of the topic itself but because the modern didactic of science suggests that the students have an evolution in their understanding and knowledge similar to the historical evolution of the ideas. In this way the initial approach to understand the world is similar to the Aristotelic vision of the Physics, then it changes in a similar way than the history with progressive mental revolutions somehow equivalent to the Kunn historical interpretation. Also the possibility of progress depend on the hability to identify previous ideas that are considered necessaries but however they are hypothesis somehow arbitaries (as commented Einstein about his evolution in the interpreation of the physics ideas).ö
