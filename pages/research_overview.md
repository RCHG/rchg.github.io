### Overview
---

My main field of research is the climate response to several agents on the atmosphere, either greenhouse gases or aerosols. However, my academic career started with a B.A. in Spanish from the University of Granada, where I graduated on Physics with an specialization on Theoretical Physics. Awarded with a scholarship, I obtained a M.Sc. on Condensed Matter with an dissertation about Theory of Liquids (Statistical Physics of Fluids) at the University Autónoma of Madrid, wehere also I was teacher assistant on Laboraties of Experimental Physics during two years. In the field of Atmospheric Sciences, I have a PhD on Remote Sensing and Micro-physics of Precipitation at Spain with an stage at NASA Goddard Space Center (sponsored by University of Maryland-Baltimore County). My experience as Postdoctoral research assistant includes the institutions: *Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany)*, where I worked on ESA-Sentinel-5 and G3E projects (remote sensing of greenhouse gases), The *University of Reading*, in collaboration with Keith Shine and M. Hegglin, where I studed the radiative forcing of several agents on the atmosphere, in particular Ozone and *Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment (LSCE)* were I work for the CNRS on the climate modelling of Earth System with a focus on natural aerosols.

[comment]: <> (My research background cover several fields and a broad set of methodologies both theoretical and experimental, with a strong focus on computational tools. My initial formation is Physics with an specialization on Theoretical Physics. This side was developed during my M.Sc. in Condensed Matter which was related with Statistical Physics in a theoretical field of Theory of Liquids. However my interest has been moved to the field of Atmospheric Sciences and Remote Sensing. Therefore the main scope of my PhD was related with Micro-physics of rainfall and remote sensing of precipitation, which also involves Applied Statistics. Actually I am working at the field of Remote Sensing of Trace Gases, this improves my knowledge on radiative transfer theory, inverse problem,satellite product, and spectroscopy)

### Researcher: KIT

The central goal of the project I am working is related with a consolidation of the ESA satellite Sentinel-5 requirements. This means a detailed study of the different error sources like instrumental, spectroscopy, forward models errors derived of an effective description of the atmosphere aerosols and cirrus. To be able to conduct this research I use state of the art retrieval algorithms (inverse problem and radiative transfer solver) with trial ensembles of geophysical scenarios. Additional aspects of the research are: evaluate the cloud cover with Meteosat datasets, integrate satellite products of MODIS and CALIPSO with datasets obtained from offline chemical transport model.

### PhD. Dissertation

**Important Note:**  I would recommend check [link](https://spideroak.com/browse/share/checagarcia/phddissertation) to download a PDF file with the Dissertation. However, please note that this version (and the version I uploaded to the arXiv repository) are not equal the official filled version at my university. More specifically: I finished my PhD Dissertation on November 2011. However because it was not filled until June-2012, I included additional research that I did by myself (alone) on the filled version. But also after finish my PhD (on September-2012) still I worked on several the same topics and I have included several improvements on the PDF on the version uploaded to arXiv (and on the first pdf linked above).

**First measurement of the small-scale spatial variability of the rain drop size distribution: Results from a crucial experiment and maximum entropy modeling** (R Checa-Garcia) arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5649 (2013)

**Abstract:**
The main challenges of measuring precipitation are related to the spatio-temporal variability of the drop-size distribution, to the uncertainties that condition the modeling of that distribution, and to the instrumental errors present in the in situ estimations. This PhD dissertation proposes advances in all these questions. The relevance of the spatial variability of the drop-size distribution for remote sensing measurements and hydro-meteorology field studies is asserted by analyzing the measurement of a set of disdrometers deployed on a network of 5 squared kilometers. This study comprises the spatial variability of integral rainfall parameters, the ZR relationships, and the variations within the one moment scaling method. The modeling of the drop-size distribution is analyzed by applying the MaxEnt method and comparing it with the methods of moments and the maximum likelihood. The instrumental errors are analyzed with a compressive comparison of sampling and binning uncertainties that affect actual devices. These analysis are further extended in several appendices where an error analysis is developed and new studies are proposed. The relevance of the pre-processing of disdrometric measurements is also assessed. The data-sets evaluated comprise experimental measurements of the GPM (NASA-JAXA) ground validation satellite mission and synthetic distributions generated computationally.

### M.Sc. Thesis

**Intrinsic structure of liquid surface and capillary waves on the Density Functional Theory** (R Checa-Garcia) arXiv preprint arXiv:1307.6199 (2013)

**Abstract:**
Two different theories are used to understand the liquid-vapor interfaces: the Van der Waals theory and the capillary waves theory. But when comparing both frameworks come up a problem of interpretation of the interface density profiles obtained, for example, with the Density Functional Theory (DFT). As a consequence emerge the question of how the surface fluctuations are included on traditional density profiles (usually named equilibrium density profiles). Last years, new insights on the role of capillary waves were possible by analyzing X-ray reflectivity experiments and performing computer simulations of liquids with low melting temperature. In particular, the density profile exhibits a layering structure which is considered a key property to elucidate a new interpretation of those profiles as intrinsic density profiles. This dissertation aims to investigate these questions within the DFT using simple fluids with a pairwise interactions that reproduce important phase-diagram properties of liquid metals. Two generics questions were explored: the relevance of Fisher-Widom line and the role of capillary waves on the nature of interface obtained with approximations WDA and FMT. It hypothesized the existence of a density profile with strong layering properties whose structure is reduced by capillary waves. Then the effect of surface fluctuations is described by introducing an effective transversal size which imposes a limitation of the spectrum of surface fluctuations incorporated on the DFT. However, an explicit methodology to unfreeze the capillary waves over a postulated intrinsic profile exempt of surface fluctuations was proven still a challenge. As a consequence it suggested that other previous results describing the liquid surface using the equilibrium DFT may conduct to unphysical properties.
