### About my academic background
---

My research background covers several fields and a broad set of methodologies with a focus on computational skills and statistical methods. My initial formation is Physics, with
an specialization on Statistical Theoretical Physics. In my PhD I investigated
in field of Atmospheric Sciences and Remote Sensing, in particular in micro-physics
and remote sensing of precipitation, which also involved Applied Statistics.
Currently I am working at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and my research is about
Remote Sensing of Trace Gases, with specific topics related with spectroscopy, radiative
transfer theory, inverse problems and processing of satellite products.
