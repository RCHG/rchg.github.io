	on self-reports or peer reports that may be subject to contrast effects,
	resulting in biased estimates of genetic and environmental influences.
	In the German Observational Study of Adult Twins (GOSAT), personality
	traits of 168 monozygotic (MZ) and 132 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs
	were rated on 35 adjective scales, largely markers of the Big 5.
	The ratings were provided by 120 judges who never met the twins but
	observed videotaped behaviors of 1 twin of each pair in 1 of 15 different
	settings. The aggregated video-based trait ratings were highly reliable,
	and substantial correlations were obtained between MZ as well as
	DZ twins. Model-fit analyses suggested about 40\% genetic, 25\% shared
	environmental, and 35\% nonshared environmental influence. Extraversion
	was the only trait that seemed not to be influenced by shared environment.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is the most important greenhouse gas (GHG)
	in the atmosphere and is the greatest contributor to global warming.
	CO(2) concentration data are usually obtained from ground observation
	stations or from a small number of satellites. Because of the limited
	number of observations and the short time series of satellite data,
	it is difficult to monitor CO(2) concentrations on regional or global
	scales for a long time. The use of the remote sensing data such as
	the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) or Moderate
	Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data can overcome these
	problems, particularly in areas with low densities of CO(2) concentration
	watch stations. A model based on temperature (MOD11C3), vegetation
	cover (MOD13C2 and MOD15A2) and productivity (MOD17A2) of MODIS (which
	we have named the TVP model) was developed in the current study to
	assess CO(2) concentrations on a global scale. We assumed that CO(2)
	concentration from the Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon
	Observation (TANSO) aboard the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite
	(GOSAT) are the true values and we used these values to check the
	TVP model accuracy. The results indicate that the accuracy of the
	TVP model is different in different continents: the greatest Pearson's
	correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.75 in Eurasia (RMSE = 1.16) and
	South America (RMSE = 1.17); the lowest R2 was 0.57 in Australia
	(RMSE = 0.73). Compared with the TANSO-observed CO(2) concentration
	(XCO(2)), we found that the accuracy throughout the World is between
	-2.56~3.14 ppm. Potential sources of TVP model uncertainties were
	also analyzed and identified.},

	availability, both of which decrease in the dry season over Amazonian
	regions with substantial dry season length, suggesting a parallel
	decrease in gross primary production (GPP). Using additional SeaWinds
	Scatterometer onboard QuikSCAT satellite measurements of canopy water
	content, we found a concomitant decrease in daily storage of canopy
	water content within branches and leaves during the dry season, supporting
	our conclusion. A large part (r(2) = 0.75) of the variance in observed
	monthly midday fluorescence from GOSAT is explained by water stress
	over moderately stressed evergreen forests over Amazonia, which is
	reproduced by model simulations that include a full physiological
	representation of photosynthesis and fluorescence. The strong relationship
	between GOSAT and model fluorescence (r(2) = 0.79) was obtained using
	a fixed leaf area index, indicating that GPP changes are more related
	to environmental conditions than chlorophyll contents. When the dry
	season extended to drought in 2010 over Amazonia, midday basin-wide
	GPP was reduced by 15 per cent compared with 2009.},

	between 18 and 70 years of age. A major aim of the GOSAT lies in
	the utilization of different modes of measurement, (i.e., peer reports
	and observational data), in addition to self-reports which have been
	used predominantly in past behavioral genetic research on personality
	and temperament in adults. Participants completed a full day assessment
	at the University of Bielefeld including videotaped social interactions
	and presentations, psychometric intelligence tests and computerized
	elementary cognitive tasks as well as objective measures and unobtrusive
	behavior counts. The research design of the GOSAT was devised to
	reduce the potential impact of systematic rater bias on estimates
	of genetic and environmental influences to a minimum. In combination
	with extensive self- and peer report data on key personality and
	personality related dimensions available from the BiLSAT, the GOSAT
	provides a rich dataset, which currently includes DNA samples from
	80\% of its participants.},

  abstract = {After briefly recapitulating two earlier German twin studies (BiLSAT
	and GOSAT), we present two new German twin studies with a longitudinal
	perspective: CoSMoS and TwinPaW. The twin study on Cognitive ability,
	Self-reported Motivation and School performance (CoSMoS) aims to
	investigate predictors and influences of school performance in a
	genetically sensitive design, beginning with children in late elementary
	school. The Twin study on Personality And Wellbeing (TwinPaW) focuses
	on adult personality and its relation to physical health as well
	as health-related behavior in an adult sample of twins. Both studies
	are characterized by an effort to recruit new large twin samples
	through a novel recruitment procedure aimed at reducing self-selective
	sampling. In two German federal states, contact information on persons
	born on the same day and with the same name was retrieved from record
	sections. From the resulting pool of more than 36,000 addresses we
	contacted approximately 2000 parents of twins aged 9 and 10 for CoSMoS,
	as well as 2000 adult twin pairs for TwinPaW by telephone and mail.
	Personal contact by telephone proved to be more efficient with agreement
	rates of 63\% in the children sample and 65\% in the adult sample.
	In this article we briefly describe the rationale and the study aims
	of CoSMoS and TwinPaW as well as the characteristics of the sample
	we have recruited so far.},
